# **Module 2 — Section Loop**

## **Purpose**
Summarize each section independently using a reliable, repeatable workflow.

## **Workflow**
For each section in order:
1. Extract section text or mark missing.  
2. If present but <50 words → flag as {short}.  
3. Generate a **20–80 word** summary using only the section text.  
4. Generate **3–8 glossary terms** with definitions grounded in that section.  
5. Apply hallucination controls:
   - No invented claims, results, or content  
   - No invented terminology  
   - No summarizing absent content

## **Outputs**
For each section:
- Section summary (20–80 words)  
- Per-section glossary  
- Flags: missing / empty / short
